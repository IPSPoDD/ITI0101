<p style="width:75%"><b>Trigonometry</b> (from Greek trigōnon, <i>"triangle"</i> and metron, <i>"measure"</i>) is a branch of mathematics that studies relationships between side lengths and angles of triangles. <br>
    The field emerged in the Hellenistic world during the 3rd century BC from applications of geometry to astronomical studies. The Greeks focused on the calculation of 
    chords, while mathematicians in India created the earliest-known tables of values for trigonometric ratios (also called trigonometric functions) such as sine.

    Throughout history, trigonometry has been applied in areas such as geodesy, surveying, celestial mechanics, and navigation. <br>
    
    Trigonometry is known for its many identities, which are equations used for rewriting trigonometrical expressions to solve equations, to find a more useful expression, 
    or to discover new relationships. <br></p>
